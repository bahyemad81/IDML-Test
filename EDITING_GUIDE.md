# 📝 Page-by-Page Editing Guide

Your app ALREADY has page-by-page (segment-by-segment) editing!

## How It Works:

### Step 1: Upload & Translate
1. Upload your IDML file
2. Select target language (Arabic/English)
3. Click "🚀 Translate Now"

### Step 2: Review & Edit Interface Appears

After translation completes, you'll see:

```
📝 Review & Edit Translation

📊 X text segments found for review

[⬅️ Previous]  [Jump to segment: 1]  [Next ➡️]

Segment 1 of X

📄 Original Text
[Read-only text box showing original English]

🌐 Translation (editable)
[Editable text box - EDIT HERE!]
```

### Step 3: Navigate Between Pages/Segments

**Three ways to navigate:**

1. **Previous/Next Buttons**
   - Click "⬅️ Previous" to go back
   - Click "Next ➡️" to go forward

2. **Jump to Segment**
   - Type segment number (e.g., 5)
   - Press Enter to jump directly

3. **Edit Any Segment**
   - Edit the translation text
   - Your changes are saved automatically
   - Navigate to next segment
   - Come back anytime to edit again!

### Step 4: Approve & Download

When you're done reviewing all segments:
- Click "✅ Approve & Download"
- Your edits are applied to the IDML
- Download both IDML and Word files

## Key Features:

✅ **Edit one segment at a time** (not all at once)
✅ **Navigate forward/backward** freely
✅ **Jump to any segment** directly
✅ **Changes saved automatically**
✅ **See original + translation** side by side
✅ **Approve when ready**

## Example Workflow:

1. Upload file → Translate
2. **Segment 1**: Edit translation → Click "Next"
3. **Segment 2**: Edit translation → Click "Next"
4. **Segment 3**: Looks good → Click "Next"
5. **Segment 4**: Edit translation → Click "Previous" to go back to Segment 3
6. **Segment 3**: Make another edit → Click "Next" twice to Segment 5
7. Continue until all segments reviewed
8. Click "✅ Approve & Download"
